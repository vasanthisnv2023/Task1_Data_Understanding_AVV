# Dataset Analysis Report – Titanic Dataset

## 1. Introduction
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographic details, ticket information, and survival status. This report aims to analyze the structure, data types, and machine learning readiness of the dataset.

## 2. Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of multiple rows, where each row represents an individual passenger. The columns include attributes such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and survival outcome.

## 3. Data Types
The dataset includes different types of data:
- Numerical features such as Age and Fare
- Categorical features such as Sex and Embarked
- A binary target variable Survived
- An ordinal feature Pclass representing passenger class order

## 4. Data Quality Issues
Some columns in the dataset contain missing values, especially Age and Cabin. Additionally, the target variable shows slight class imbalance, which may affect model performance if not addressed.

## 5. Target Variable and Features
The target variable in this dataset is Survived, which indicates whether a passenger survived or not. All other columns are considered input features for model training.

## 6. Machine Learning Suitability
The dataset contains a sufficient number of records and relevant features, making it suitable for basic machine learning tasks after performing necessary preprocessing steps.

## 7. Conclusion
Overall, the Titanic dataset is well-structured and appropriate for understanding data analysis concepts and preparing data for machine learning models.
