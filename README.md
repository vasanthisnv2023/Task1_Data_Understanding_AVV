# Task 1 – Understanding Dataset & Data Types

## Objective
The objective of this task is to explore a dataset, understand its structure, identify data types, check for missing values, and analyze its suitability for machine learning.

## Dataset Used
- Titanic Dataset (publicly available)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Key Observations
- Dataset contains numerical, categorical, binary, and ordinal features
- Some columns have missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin)
- Target variable is binary (Survived)
- Dataset is suitable for basic ML tasks after preprocessing

## Files Included
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset file (`titanic.csv`)
- Dataset Analysis Report (`Dataset_Analysis_Report.md`)
- README.md

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates data understanding and prepares the dataset for machine learning modeling.
